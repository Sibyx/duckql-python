## Development

Project is managed by [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) and documentation is generated by
[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). If you want to generate documentation you need to follow these simple steps:

1. `pipenv install`
2. `pipenv shell`
3. `mkdocs build`

Documentation should be in `site` directory. You can also download documentation for each release from
[GitLab](https://gitlab.backbone.sk/backboneql/backboneql-python/tags).

Inside of pipenv shell, you can also use `mkdocs serve` to create temporary auto-reload http server with live docs.

We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) for unit tests and [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
for code-style validation. You can execute tests inside of pipenv shell using these commands:

- `pytest -v .`: executes unit tests
- `pytest -v --flake8 .`: flake8 code-style tests
