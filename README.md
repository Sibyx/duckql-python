## Documentation

Project is managed by [pipenv]() and documentation is generated by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). If you want to
generate documentation you need to follow these simple steps:

- `pipenv install`
- `pipenv shell`
- `mkdocs build`

Documentation should be in `site` directory. You can also download documentation for each release from
[GitLab](https://gitlab.backbone.sk/backboneql/backboneql-python/tags).
